fossology (3.0.0) unstable; urgency=low

  * New Features
    *New folder navigation** : Jquery based table UI for downloads including sorting and filtering with more handling attributes per upload.
    *New license UI for editing concluded licenses** : Instead of providing a separate UI for license conclusion, now a single file view license UI allows for efficient license situation review: highlighted texts and selected licenses are moving together to one view now.
    *Re-use of license decisions** : At uploading a new file, a user can select existing uploads for reusing already applied license decisions, if the file hash is the same.
    *Bulk assignment of license decisions based on text phrases** : When identifying a phrase hinting to particular license (e.g. "license info can be found in readme"), the user can define this text as search string and assign a license decision to every matching file.
    *Auto-decision of the Monk and Nomos scanner find the same license in the same text area** : If both scanners find the same license by short name, then a license decision can be applied automatically.
    *Adding Ninka as optional scanner** : At upload or at scheduling jobs, the user can run Ninka scanner with FOSSology as third license scanner.
    *New UI for editing copyrights** : Separate display for URL, E-Mails, copyright statements and authorship notes.
    *Adding the concept of candidate licenses, to let users add licenses as candidates for the system** : New licenses must be added carefully to the server database. However, in order not to stop a user a reviewing an upload, candidate licenses can be registered for addition to the server by the server admin later.
    *License import and export using a CSV interface** : Using CSV formatted files, licenses with the reference texts can be imported and exported to the FOSSology server.
    *Adding readme / copying file generation** : Concluded licenses and copyright statements are written into a text file that is information for the distribution.
    *SPDX 2.0 file generation** : Based on the scan results and concluded licenses, SPDX 2.0 XML format is generated (passes verification tool).
  * Issues: Corrections

fossology (2.6.0) unstable; urgency=low

    * monk.  This is a new license scanner contributed by our friends at Siemens and TNGTech.  Monk looks for complete licenses (as defined in the database) and reports the percentage match (see also License highlighting below).
    * License highlighting.  Now when you view a license you can see exactly what was added or removed from a license.  This works especially well with monk since monk scans for complete licenses (stored in the fossology database).  But it also works to show you what snippet nomos matched to identify a license.
    * New license browser
    * fo_copyright_list can now list files that contain a copyright, or list files that do not contain a copyright.
    * fo_license_list has new options to exclude licenses (or directories)
    * Many new licenses added
    * Old bugs fixed, new ones added. see our "issue tracker": (link outdated)
