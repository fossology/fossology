### ScanCode Toolkit
ScanCode Toolkit is a very established license scanner. It is a simple python based command line scanner that runs on Windows, Linux, and Mac. It implements a number of different approaches and integrates these into one application for identifying and classifying license-relevant content in packages.

A wrapper has been used to wrap ScanCode around FOSSology.

See Integrating scancode blog: https://fossology.github.io/gsoc/docs/2021/scancode/
