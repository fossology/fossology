 * @section reuserabout About Reuser agent
 * If you have already uploaded a version of a package and clearing has been
 * done on it. While uploading the next version of it, you can reuse the
 * clearing decisions from the previous upload saving you lot of time.
 *
 * The files from both uploads (new and old) are compared using their hash.
 * If there is a match, the clearing decisions from reused upload file are
 * copied to the new upload file.
 *
 * Reuser also supports enhanced reuse mode (which can be slow). This mode
 * will copy a clearing decision if the two files differ by one line determined
 * by the `diff` tool.
 *
 * Reuser also supports reusing the main license(s) which copies any main
 * license decisions from old upload to new upload.
 *
 * @section reuseractions Supported actions
 * Currently, unified report agent does not support CLI commands and read only
 * from scheduler.
