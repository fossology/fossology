 *
 * More developer information can be found at http://www.fossology.org/projects/fossology/wiki/Developer_Documentation
 *
 * \section about About
 * FOSSology is a open source license compliance software system and toolkit.
 * As a toolkit you can run license, copyright and export control scans from the command line.
 * As a system, a database and web ui are provided to give you a compliance workflow.
 * In one click you can generate an SPDX file, or a ReadMe with all the copyrights
 * notices from your software. FOSSology deduplication means that you can scan an entire distro,
 * rescan a new version, and only the changed files will get rescanned. This is a big time saver for large projects.
 * [Check out Who Uses FOSSology!](http://www.fossology.org/projects/fossology/wiki/WhoUsesFOSSology)
 * FOSSology does not give legal advice.
 *
 * \section requirements Requirements
 * The PHP versions 5.5.9 to 7.1.x are supported to work for FOSSology.
 * FOSSology requires Postgresql as database server and apache httpd 2.4 as web server.
 * These and more dependencies are installed by `utils/fo-installdeps`.
 *
 * \section installation Installation
 * FOSSology should work with many Linux distributions.
 *
 * See https://github.com/fossology/fossology/releases for source code download of the releases.
 *
 * For installation instructions see [Github Wiki](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki)
 * \subsection dockerinstallation Docker
 * FOSSology comes with a Dockerfile allowing the containerized execution
 * both as single instance or in combination with an external PostgreSQL database.
 * **Note:** It is strongly recommended to use an external database for production
 * use, since the the standalone image does not take care of data persistency.
 *
 * A pre-built Docker image is available from [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/fossology/fossology/)
 * and can be run using following command:
 * \code docker run -p 8081:80 fossology/fossology \endcode
 *
 * The docker image can then be used using http://IP_OF_DOCKER_HOST:8081/repo user fossy passwd fossy.
 *
 * Execution with external database container can be done using Docker Compose.
 * The Docker Compose file is located under the `/install` folder can can be run using following command:
 * \code
 * cd install
 * docker-compose up
 * \endcode
 *
 * The Docker image allows configuration of it's database connection over a set of environment variables.
 * - **FOSSOLOGY_DB_HOST:** Hostname of the PostgreSQL database server.
 *     An integrated PostgreSQL instance is used if not defined or set to `localhost`.
 * - **FOSSOLOGY_DB_NAME:** Name of the PostgreSQL database. Defaults to `fossology`.
 * - **FOSSOLOGY_DB_USER:** User to be used for PostgreSQL connection. Defaults to `fossy`.
 * - **FOSSOLOGY_DB_PASSWORD:** Password to be used for PostgreSQL connection. Defaults to `fossy`.
 * \subsection installationvagrant Vagrant
 * FOSSology comes with a VagrantFile that can be used to create an isolated environment for FOSSology and its dependencies.
 *
 * **Pre-requisites:**  Vagrant >= 2.x and Virtualbox >= 5.2.x
 * **Steps:**
 * \code
 * git clone https://github.com/fossology/fossology
 * cd fossology/
 * vagrant up
 * \endcode
 *
 * The server must be ready at [http://localhost:8081/repo/](http://localhost:8081/repo/) and user can login the credentials using
 * \code
 * user: fossy
 * pass: fossy
 * \endcode
 *
