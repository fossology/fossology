 * \tableofcontents
 * \section schedulerabout About scheduler
 * The FOSSology job scheduler is a daemon that periodically checks the job
 * queue and spawns agents to run scans. Multiple jobs can be run simultaneously
 * as defined in fossology.conf.
 * \section schedulerterminology Terminology
 * \subsection jobstreamterm Job stream
 *     A list of all the job steps queued at the same time for an upload.
 *     For example, all the job steps (programs) necessary to get a particular
 *     upload from unpack through all of its scans.
 * \subsection jobterm Job
 *     A specific step in the process of working on an upload. Each job would
 *     be associated with a different type of agent. For example if a person
 *     uploaded a .tar file and wanted license and copyright analysis run on the
 *     file, there would be a job for the unpack step, a job for the license step
 *     and a job for the copyright step.
 * \subsection agentterm Agent
 *     The actual process that the scheduler will spawn and be communicating
 *     with. An instance of the copyright scanner would be an example of an
 *     agent. A job is a scheduler construct used to run an agent process.
 * \section schedulerarchitecture Scheduler Architecture
 * Scheduler use a classic client server communication style for both the agent
 * communication and the UI communication. Every time a new communication
 * channel is needed, the scheduler will create a new thread to manage the
 * communications with that channel. This makes the communication logic much simpler.
 *
 * If the communication thread receives anything that would involve changing a
 * data structure internal to the scheduler, it passes the information off to
 * the main thread instead of changing it personally. The communication threads send
 * information to the main thread using events. The communication thread will package
 * the function and arguments and pass it to a concurrent queue that the main thread
 * is waiting on.
 *
 * When a new job stream is found in the job queue, the scheduler will create only
 * the jobs for that job stream that have all the preconditions fulfilled. Once
 * created the jobs will have agents allocated to them. Allocated agents belong
 * to the job and will remain in the scheduler's data structures until the job
 * is removed from the system. Jobs are responsible for cleaning up any agents
 * allocated to them.
 *
 * Within a job, when an agent is ready for data, it will inform the main thread
 * that it is waiting. The main thread will then take a chunk of data from the
 * job that the agent belongs to and allocate it to the agent. The communication
 * thread will then be responsible for sending the data to the corresponding
 * process. It is important to note that the communication threads are using
 * blocking IO on the pipe from the corresponding process. As a result, any
 * string that starts with "@" is reserved as a communication from the scheduler
 * instead of the corresponding process. Writing anything that starts with "@"
 * to stdout within an agent will result in undefined behavior.
 *
 * Here are some other properties of the scheduler:
 * - Scheduler can take advantage of multiple processors on whatever machine it is running on.
 * - Simplified code for communicating with agents since all IO would be blocking instead of non-blocking.
 * - Master thread can not get swamped with communications between the agents and can concentrate on managing new jobs.
 * - Uses GLib
 * - Job queue is implemented in db tables:
 *     - **job** - the job stream
 *     - **jobqueue** - individual jobs
 *     - **jobdepends** - job dependencies (for example, you can't run buckets until the license scan is done)
 *
 * [More info on scheduler](https://github.com/fossology/fossology/wiki/Job-Scheduler)
 * \section scheduleractions Communicating with scheduler
 * You can send commands to a running scheduler. The scheduler listens on the
 * port specified in fossology.conf. After a command is sent, the scheduler will
 * respond with "received". You can send the following commands:
 *
 * | Command | Definition |
 * | ---: | :--- |
 * | close   | Close the connection to the scheduler. |
 * | stop    | Scheduler will gracefully shutdown after the currently running jobs have finished. |
 * | pause <job_id> | The job id (job_pk) will pause. All agents associated with the job will be put to sleep. |
 * | agents  | Respond with a space separated list of agents configured to run. |
 * | reload  | Reload the configuration information for the agents and hosts. |
 * | status  | Respond on the same socket with all of the status information. |
 * | status <job_id> | Respond with a detailed status for the specific job. |
 * | restart <job_id> | Restart the job specified. |
 * | verbose | The verbosity level for the scheduler will be changed to match level. |
 * | verbose <job_id> | The verbosity level for all of the agents owned by the specified job will be changed to level. |
 * | priority | Changes the priority of a particular job within the scheduler. |
 * | database | Check the database job queue for new jobs. |
