 * @brief This is a simple test agent meant to be used by Unit and functional
 *        tests to confirm a correctly working scheduler.
 *
 *        This agent will set
 *        itself to NOKILL, wait long enough that the scheduler would have
 *        killed it. Then set itself back to be able to be killed, and wait
 *        till the scheduler would kill it. Then finish.
 *
 * @note This is a failing agent
