CFLAGS:
The default CFLAGS for all C compilation is "-g -O2 -Wall". Let's say
you wanted to build the whole tree with debugging and warnings but
without optimization. You could do that with

  $ make clean; make CFLAGS=-g -Wall

See the code for how to simulate running from the scheduler.
Hint:   echo 158 | ./demomod -c /usr/local/etc/fossology/
Where 158 is an upload_pk, and user_pk is set in the code.

quicktest:
./demomod myfile.o

gdb -c core --args ./demomod  -v myfile.o

valgrind --tool=memcheck --leak-check=yes ./demomod -v myfile.o  2&> valgrind.out
