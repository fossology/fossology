demomod is a working demonstration FOSSology module.  All you have to do is a make, sudo make install,
and link this directory in your fossology/mods-enabled/ 

If you are writing a module for the first time, study this.  You can also use it as a template for 
writing a new module.  Just duplicate the demomod directory tree for your new module.  That will give
you the file structure as well as the basic code for the agent and UI. Then go through the code
substituting the demo functionality for your code.
