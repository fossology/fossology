/*
 * Here is the spec:
 *
 * fointeg [-a] [-b] [-f] [-h] [-i] [-t] [-u]
 * -a: run everything, build, install, unit and functional tests
 * -b: make clean, make
 * -f: run functional tests (which build/install and run func tests)
 * -h: this help message
 * -i: install upstream sources
 * -t: run unit and functional tests (assumes a make and or a make install have
 * been done).
 * -u: run unit tests (make tests, and process results)
 *
 * This is what the makefile should call, later, add in --options as well.
 *
 * The plan:
 * - for phpunit, use the xml and junit options
 * - for simpletest? maybe use phpini? or a naming convention? (I like ini)
 * - parse the input files as well so you know what files were run, then
 * compare to the rest of the files in the dir.
 *
 *  May still have to do a file or mimetype on each file to know how to run it.
 *  (I am assuming that the rest of the files will be shell scripts).
 *
 *  Take a look at the shell framework that bob and norton want to use.
 *
 *  ?? Should the different options leave markers so the downstream tasks can
 *  check those to see if a build or ... nevermind.. much better for functional
 *  test to build/install and test.
