Nomos Developer Notes
=====================

Build System
------------

Nomos is integrated into the Fossology CMake build system and cannot be built independently.
There is no standalone Makefile in this directory.

To build Nomos, you must build Fossology from the repository root using CMake:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

Dependencies
------------

Building Nomos requires PostgreSQL development headers (for example, `libpq-dev` on Debian/Ubuntu).
If these headers are missing, the CMake configuration step will fail or skip building the Nomos agent.

Runtime Requirements
--------------------

Nomos is an internal Fossology agent and is not designed to be used as a standalone license scanner.
It is intended to be executed by Fossology as part of its agent pipeline.

The Nomos binary expects a Fossology runtime environment and a configuration file (`fossology.conf`)
at predefined locations. Running `./nomos` standalone is not supported and will fail or behave
unpredictably without the proper Fossology environment.
