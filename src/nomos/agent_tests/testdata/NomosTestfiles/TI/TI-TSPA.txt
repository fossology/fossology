This Software License Agreement ("Agreement") is a legal agreement between
you (either an individual or entity) and Texas Instruments Incorporated

software programs.  By installing, copying or otherwise using the Licensed
Materials you agree to abide by the terms of this Agreement.  If you choose
not to accept or agree with these terms, do not download or install the
Licensed Materials.

Note Regarding Possible Access to Open Source Software:  The Licensed

means any software licensed under terms requiring that (A) other software
("Proprietary Software") incorporated, combined or distributed with such
software or developed using such software: (i) be disclosed or distributed
in source code form; or (ii) otherwise be licensed on terms inconsistent
with the terms of this Agreement, including but not limited to permitting
use of the Proprietary Software on or with devices other than TI Devices, or

Software will be listed in the applicable software manifest (in whole or in
part, the "Open Source Materials").  Your use of the Open Source Materials
is subject to the separate licensing terms applicable to such Open Source
Materials as specified in the applicable software manifest.  For
clarification, this Agreement does not limit your rights under, or grant you
rights that supersede, the license terms of any applicable Open Source
Materials license agreement.  If any of the Open Source Materials have been
provided to you in object code only, TI will provide to you or show you
where can access the source code versions of such Open Source Materials if

provided that such termination occurs within five (5) calendar days of
acceptance of this Agreement and you abide by all applicable license terms
in this Agreement until such termination.

possible to effectuate the intent of the parties and the remainder of the
Agreement shall continue in full force and effect. This Agreement shall not
be governed by the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the
International Sale of Goods, or by the Uniform Computer Information
