Setting up cp2foss Tests

Almost all the steps are automated, but documented here. See the install 
script for details.

NOTE: make sure the version of cp2foss you want to test is installed in 
   /usr/local/bin/test.cp2foss.  That's the name the tests expect to use.
   
   This is a MANUAL STEP, please do this BEFORE running the tests
   
As root run the install script to set up the system for testing.

1. make sure test.cp2foss has the following permissions:
   
       -rwxr-xr-- 1 fossy fossy 28724 2008-04-02 15:24 test.cp2foss
   
2. copy the archives in ....cli/test/archives/* to /tmp, that is where the
   tests expect them to be.
   
3. Create a directory tree with contents for recusive tests.   The 
   tests expect the fossology source is checked out into /tmp and that is 
   used in the tests. So if you don't use this method, you will need to 
   change the tests.
