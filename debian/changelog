fossology (1.1.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release (Closes: #521864, #531864, #531866 )
  * fossology-scheduler-single now automatically gives the user a new
    Scheduler.conf, to ensure that new agents get added.
    fossology-scheduler still warns the user to review.
  * Added mail-transport-agent Suggests since the new, but optional,
    fo-notify needs sendmail(1).
