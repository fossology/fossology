Description: open and modular architecture for analyzing software
 The FOSSology project is a web based framework that allows you to
 upload software to be picked apart and then analyzed by software agents
 which produce results that are then browsable via the web interface.
 Existing agents include license analysis, metadata extraction, and MIME
 type identification.
 .
 This metapackage ensures that the fossology component packages needed
 for a single-system install are installed in the right order. For a
 multi-system install, consult the README.Debian file included in the
 fossology-common package.
