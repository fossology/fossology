## About
FOSSology is a framework for software analysis, both source and binary.
It uses a repository for unpacking and storing the uploads, "agents" 
to analyze the uploaded files, and a Postgres database to store and display
the results. Also included is a license agent for scanning source code for
potential license references. In addition to this document there is much more
information available on the website
