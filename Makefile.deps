# FOSSology Makefile dependencies
# Copyright (C) 2008-2011 Hewlett-Packard Development Company, L.P.
#
# This file contains some targets used in multiple places in the build
# tree, mostly for dependencies. They can't go in Makefile.conf because
# we don't want them to be the first target. To use them in a Makefile
# be sure to include Makefile.conf first and then include this file
# below the default target.

# set up our test config environment
#export FOSSOLOGY_TESTCONFIG := $(shell ${TOP}/dostuff.php)

# targets to ensure that the libraries are up to date before building with them
$(FOLIB):
	$(MAKE) -C $(FOLIBDIR)

# this target will set the FOSSOLOGY_TESTCONFIG variable to the value
# printed to standard output by the 'create_test_database.php' script.
#
# This value will be the SYSCONFIG directory where a temporary database
# connection (specified in Db.conf) and temporary repository location
# (specified in fossology.conf) will be placed
#
# The create_test_database.php script creates a FOSSology test database
# and FOSSology test repository, and prints a single line on standard
# output that is the location of the FOSSology sysconfdir for the test
# database. Otherwise if the script cannot generate a test database 
# for any reason, it will echo "FAIL" to stdout.
