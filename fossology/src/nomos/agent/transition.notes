Notes related to the transition of GF's original Nomos code to the current 
version of the nomos agent checked into FOSSology's svn archive on 
sourceforge.org.

Author: Anonymous
Date: 09/14/2009



Rationale: Original goal was to migrate Nomos standalone functionality into
an agent hosted in the FOSSology (henceforth referred to as FO) environment.
The purpose being to retain Nomos' license-detection technology in a new
environment.

This report is at this writing but a sketch. Details and rationale can be 
further elucidated by contacting the porter, Channing Benson 
(channing.benson@hp.com).


Notation/Etc.
-------------

Most comments that I added related to questions or decisions about the code
are marked with the string "CDB", my initials. Typically, these indicate
areas where I was unsure about how to best proceed or whether the code
there was functional or useful.


Things Left the Same:
---------------------

The entire preprocessing of STRINGS.in to _autodata.c and _autodefs.h has been
left unchanged, with one exception. Previously, the strings were obfuscated
by use of the program implemented in encode.c.  encode is still called, but
it no longer obfuscates strings, it only escapes them into octal codes.

The same is true of all the PRECHECK related files. 

Remember, all files that begin with an underscore are auto-generated.


File Changes:
-------------

Removals

Some files made no sense to retain in the context of an FO agent. The following files have been removed from the Nomos codebase:

conf.c - Stuff related to Nomos as a standalone tool no longer required in the
	FO environment.

md5.c, md5.h - Previously used for obfuscation that is no longer performed.

report.c - Code related to producing the Nomos reports. Since, the Nomos agent
	just sticks things in the DB, this is not needed. *NOTE*: a lot of 
	bucket-related code is in this file.

sources.c - Code for detecting file types and unpacking if necessary. In FO
	this work is done by other components.

Additions

For stylistic reasons, header files were added to include the constants and
entry points defined in most (all?) of the C files. Thus, for instance, for
util.c, there is now a util.h file that contains the declarations for 
functions defined in util.c. Another source file wishing to use those functions
can now just #include util.h rather than write in the function prototypes by
hand. Neat, huh?

Name Changes

For reasons related to the FO make system, the file regex.c was changed to
nomos_regex.c.



Stylistic Changes
-----------------

Many changes were made to make the code conform better to accepted norms
for C code. I'm not sure I can recall all the exact examples, but for instance:

- Declarations have been changed so that only one variable is declared on a 
line.

- Removed all "register" modifications to declarations under the assumption
that modern compilers can do a much better job of register allocation than
a programmer.

- In some cases, for loops have been altered so that they have only one variant.
The most significant of these occurs in licenses.c in the function licenseInit(). 
There are a couple "for" loops in license.s/licenseInit() that run through 
all the strings in 
_autodata.c (i = 0; i < NFOOTPRINTS ....). In the original code, there are
also two pointers that get incremented for each iteration (lp and ltp).
Instead of maintaining these two pointers, I simply use the loop variable "i"
to index into the appropriate array (licSpec for lp, and licText for ltp).

Looking at the code side-by-side will make this much more clear. There may 
be other cases of this, but this is the one that is most significant.

- In many cases, the code that invokes the debug trace functions (surrounded
by #ifdef PROC_TRACE and #ifdef PROC_TRACE_SWITCH has been replaced by a
single function, traceFunc() which has the exact same functionality, but
makes the code slightly easier to read (fewer #ifdefs). traceFunc is 
defined in util.c. Substitution of this function is intermittent because
when I started to incorporate the latest Nomos core code, I stopped making
the substitution to speed the process.

- Some comments have been edited to omit having all lines preceded by a '*'.
This makes future editing easier.


Structural Changes
------------------

The chief structural changes have been to eliminate unnecesary fields from
the gl global structure and move other elements of that structure into a 
"cur" structure (type curScan). The rationale behind this is that while the
original Nomos does a whole job in one program invocation, the agent version
of nomos will be invoked over and over again on a single file. the curScan
structure is meant to hold all information pertinent to the scan of a single
file. Thus, when a scan is finished, the structure is freed, and a new one
created to handle the next file to be scanned.


Changes in #ifdef inclusions/etc
--------------------------------

A lot of code from the original Nomos core has been removed due to it being
surrounded by particular #ifdefs.

Unfortunately, it's difficult to come up with a complete list of such code,
but side-by-side examination of the files should make it obvious. For instance,
all code surrounded by #ifdef SHOW_LOCATION has been included (and the #ifdefs
removed) because the nomos agent is always interested in storing (and showing)
the location where a particular license was found.

#defines that have been removed (along with their associated code):
[Note that questions about the meanings of these symbols should be referred
to the original author.] It is highly possible that I have missed some of
these occurrences in this document. In that case, trust the source, not what
you read here.

SAVE_REFLICENSES
VENDOR_LICENSE_REFS
ALL_ATTRIBUTIONS
BRIEF_LIST
SEARCH_CRYPTO


Random Pertinent Information
----------------------------

It really helps to know the call hierarchy used by the nomos agent to actually
detect licenses. As it is now, it looks like this:

main() calls
processRawSource() calls
processNonPackagedFiles() calls
processRegularFiles() calls
licenseScan() calls [this function maintains the "score" file]
saveLicenseData() calls
makeLicenseSummary() [which adds licenses to cur.compLic]

I have a note which says that the offsets (into the file) get cleared in 
the function saveLicenseData().
