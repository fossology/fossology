            To install the fossology tests you must have root or sudo powers. 
            These powers are needed as user accounts and links are created on 
            the system.  The user account created must have enough space to hold
            licenses and compressed tar archives for uploading as part of the 
            tests.  The amount of space is not much, about 10MB.

         The fossology test suites are designed to be run from the sources.  
         This cuts down on installation time and test infrastructure maintanence.
