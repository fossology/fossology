FOSSology for Debian
--------------------
FOSSology is a web based application. In addition to installing the
fossology packages you need to configure some other services on your
system like a webserver and database. Then you access FOSSology with
your web browser.

Single vs. Multi-system installs:
The FOSSology software has been split into separate packages according
to function in order to make it easy to split the work across machines.

* If you want to run everything on a single system just install the
"fossology" meta-package and it will do the right thing. See the
Additional Setup section below.

* If you want to do a multi-system install read the upstream
INSTALL.multi document and then
1) On the database machine: install fossology-db.
2) On each of the agents machine(s):
 a) install fossology-common
 b) edit /etc/fossology/Db.conf and point it at the database machine
 c) if you like, edit /etc/fossology/fossology.conf to point at a non-default
    repository location
 d) edit /etc/fossology/fossology.conf and list the agent machines
    according to the format explained in the upstream documentation
    and to how you want to split the repository.
 e) create the directory $REPO/<hostname> where that hostname is the
   name of the machine as listed in fossology.conf. This directory should
   be root:fossy 2770.
 f) setup nfs so that each agent's $REPO/<hostname> directory is exported
    to all of the other agent/scheduler/web machines.
 g) on all the agent machines mount each of the other agents at
    $REPO/<hostname>
 i) install agent pacakges (e.g.fossology-ununpack)
3) On each of the web machine(s):
 a) install fossology-common
 b) edit /etc/fossology/Db.conf and point it at the database machine
 c) mount each of all of the agent machines at $REPO/<hostname>
 d) install fossology-web
4) On the scheduler machine:
 a) install fossology-common
 b) edit /etc/fossology/Db.conf and point it at the database machine
 c) mount each of all of the agent machines at $REPO/<hostname>
 d) install fossology-scheduler
 e) Use mkschedconf to generate a new Scheduler.conf with your
   preferences for machines and CPU counts.
5) On all machines:
 a) ensure that the fossy UID/GIDs that were created on all machines
   are the same
 b) make sure all nfs mounts are working and as fossy you can write to the
   repository
6) On the scheduler:
 a) restart the scheduler '/etc/init.d/fossology restart'


Additional Setup:
The Debian packages do most of what you need to install FOSSology. In
addition to installing the packages you need to do the following steps
from the upstream INSTALL document

* Adjust the kernel shmmax (database)
* Adjust the postgresql config (database)
* Adjust the apache config (web)
* Adjust the php config (web)

All of these will be dependent on the goals of your local system and
can't be reasonably automated, so you'll have to do them by hand.

After you have installed the packages and done the above adjustments,
you can point your web browser at at the new install
  http://yourhostname/repo/
and start using FOSSology!

NOTE: Upstream is planning on eventually moving the things specified in
this config file into the database and be managed via the web
interface, which will allow for more seamless upgrades.

The FOSSology database:
The fossology-db package Depends on postgresql and will create the
fossology database when installed. This requires that postgresql is
running and accessible when the package is installed. If you want to
have FOSSology use a remote database or you want to create the
fossology by hand, do not install fossology-db. Instead setup the
database as you want it, and edit /etc/fossology/Db.conf accordingly.

Migrating from upstream:
* If you are migrating from an upstream install, you will need to run
the upstream utils/fo-cleanold utility in order to clean off old
binaries that would be in the PATH and really confuse things. You
should be able to run it with no options, which will save your config
files and leave your database and repository intact. Then install the
packages as described above and migrate any config file changes to the
new config files.
* If you are coming from a pre-1.0.0 install you have edits to php.ini
that you will no longer need and should clean up. See the current
upstream INSTALL document for what is still needed.
* The upstream init script, default file, and apache config will be
pointing at the upstream install locations. Because these are conffiles,
you may still have the old versions after install and need to adjust
them to point to the package locations.
