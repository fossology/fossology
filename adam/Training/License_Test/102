      The Compose menu choice will take you to a new Compose page.
      Here you will find several fields and a couple of buttons.
      Depending on how you got to the compose view, some of these 
      fields may already be filled in.

      From
   </title>
   <description>
      <p>The <B>From:</B> field will only be displayed if you have enabled multiple
      identities (through the Options, Personal Preferences menu). If you've done
      so you can choose which identity you want to use, i.e. which name and
      email address appear as the From-line of your message.

      To
   </title>
   <description>
      <p>
      Next is the <B>To:</B> field.  In this field you should 
      enter the email address of the person or persons you are sending a 
      message to.  You may enter as many addresses as you like, separating 
      them with a comma.  One may also press the "Addresses" button to fill 
      in the field.  Don't worry if the entire address is not displayed.
      The field is a fixed length, but everything you put in it will be used,
      even though it might scroll to the right or left.

      Cc
   </title>
   <description>
      <p>
      Next is the <B>CC:</B> field.  CC is an abbreviation for <B>C</B>arbon 
      <B>C</B>opy.  If you wish to send someone else a copy of the message 
      here is where you would do that.  Think of this in the same way a memo 
      is laid out.  You can have as many people as you like in the <B>To:</B>, 
      <B>CC:</B>, and <B>BCC:</B> fields.  Only the people to whom the message 
      has direct impact would be in the <B>To:</B> field while recipients to 
      whom this is possibly only informative would be in the <B>CC:</B> and 
      <B>BCC:</B> fields.

      BCC is an abbreviation for <B>B</B>lind <B>C</B>arbon <B>C</B>opy.
      Use this to send someone a copy of the email <I>without</I> the 
      recipients in the <B>To:</B> or <B>CC:</B> fields knowing about it.

      Type in a relevant heading here.  Remember, email can be a great time 
      saver and an accurate subject line is one big reason.

      Addresses Button
   </title>
   <description>
      <p>
      This button will open the address book after a search box is presented.
      Something must be entered in the search box to retrieve a result.
      If all addresses in the address book are required, press the List All button.
       The address book has enough functionality 
      that it deserves its own section. More detailed information is 
      available in the "Addresses" chapter.

      Save Draft button

   <description>
      <p>
      If you've been composing a message but for some reason aren't ready
      to send it yet, you can use this button to save the message in the
      Drafts folder. If later you want to finish the message and send it out,
      go to the Drafts folder, open the message and you will return to the
      compose page with your message filled in.

      Priority

   <description>
      <p>
      If enabled by your system administrator, at the right of the
      buttons a drop down list "Priority" is available. Here you can
      select, surprisingly, the priority of this message. A high-priority
      message might be presented in a different way by the recipient's
      mail program. Note that excessive use of this function will devalue its
      effect.

      The large empty box is for whatever you want to put there.  If a 
      signature file has been saved it will appear here as well.  This is
      where you type the body of your message.

      Attach
   </title>
   <description>
      <p>
      Located at the bottom of the Compose page, this feature allows you to 
      include a file with your email.  The file must be located on your 
      <I>local</I> machine or network to be attached.  A browse button is 
      present so you may search through your directory structure and click 
      on the file to include.  Alternatively you may type directly into the 
      attach field if you know the full path and exact file name.  Simply 
      press the Add button to list the selected file as an attachment and it 
      will appear below.
      </p>
      <p>
      Once at least one file is presented for attachment another button is 
      revealed.  Deletion of one or more attached files is accomplished by 
      selecting the offending file or files and pressing the delete selected 
      attachments button.
