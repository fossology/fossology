/**
 * Register a new command with the core.
 *
 * The command will only happen if commands are enabled,
 * which is a UI pref. UIs don't have to support commands at all.
 *
 * @param cmd The command. This should be a UTF8 (or ASCII) string, with no spaces
 *            or other white space.
 * @param args This tells Gaim how to parse the arguments to the command for you.
 *             If what the user types doesn't match, Gaim will keep looking for another
 *             command, unless the flag @c GAIM_CMD_FLAG_ALLOW_WRONG_ARGS is passed in f.
 *             This string contains no whitespace, and uses a single character for each argument.
 *             The recognized characters are:
 *               'w' Matches a single word.
 *               'W' Matches a single word, with formatting.
 *               's' Matches the rest of the arguments after this point, as a single string.
 *               'S' Same as 's' but with formatting.
 *             If args is the empty string, then the command accepts no arguments.
 *             The args passed to callback func will be a @c NULL terminated array of null
 *             terminated strings, and will always match the number of arguments asked for,
 *             unless GAIM_CMD_FLAG_ALLOW_WRONG_ARGS is passed.
 * @param p This is the priority. Higher priority commands will be run first, and usually the
 *          first command will stop any others from being called.
 * @param f These are the flags. You need to at least pass one of GAIM_CMD_FLAG_IM or
 *          GAIM_CMD_FLAG_CHAT (can may pass both) in order for the command to ever actually
 *          be called.
 * @param prpl_id This is the prpl's id string. This is only meaningful if the proper flag is set.
 * @param func This is the function to call when someone enters this command.
 * @param helpstr This is a whitespace sensitive, UTF-8, HTML string describing how to use the command.
 *                The preferred format of this string shall be the commands name, followed by a space
 *                and any arguments it accepts (if it takes any arguments, otherwise no space), followed
 *                by a colon, two spaces, and a description of the command in sentence form. No slash
 *                before the command name.
 * @param data User defined data to pass to the GaimCmdFunc
 * @return A GaimCmdId. This is only used for calling gaim_cmd_unregister.
 *         Returns 0 on failure.

/**
 * Do a command.
 *
 * Normally the UI calls this to perform a command. This might also be useful

 * @param cmdline The command the user typed (including all arguments) as a single string.
 *            The caller doesn't have to do any parsing, except removing the command
 *            prefix, which the core has no knowledge of. cmd should not contain any
 *            formatting, and should be in plain text (no html entities).
 * @param markup This is the same as cmd, but is the formatted version. It should be in
 *               HTML, with < > and &, at least, escaped to html entities, and should
 *               include both the default formatting and any extra manual formatting.
 * @param errormsg If the command failed errormsg is filled in with the appropriate error
 *                 message. It must be freed by the caller with g_free().
 * @return A GaimCmdStatus indicated if the command succeeded or failed.
