[FOSSOLOGY]

; REPLACEMENT for Depth.conf

; REPLACEMENT for RepPath.conf
path = /srv/fossology/repository

; REPLACEMENT for Proxy.conf
; proxy settings that will be used by fossology agents
; examples:
;http_proxy = http://server:8080
;https_proxy = http://server:18023
;ftp_proxy = http://server:3128
;no_proxy = localhost,10.1.2.3

; REPLACEMENT for Hosts.conf
; set up the set of hosts available to analyze files. If there is an entry
; for localhost it will be read, if there isn't one then it is assumed that
; localhost cannot host any agents. A man of -1 does not indicate that a 
; host can have as many agents running as necessary, (i.e. there should always
; be a max on the number of agents for a particular host).
