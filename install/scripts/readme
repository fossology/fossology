3 simple scripts to assist with FOSSology installations.

Based upon material obtained from:
http://www.fossology.org/projects/fossology/wiki/SysConfig

1. setshm.sh automates the process of "Adjusting the Kernel"

2. pgsql-conf-fix.sh automates the process of "Preparing Postgresql"
   Enhanced in 2015 to support postgresql 9.3 

3. php-conf-fix.sh automates the process of "Configuring PHP"

The three scripts have been tested and appear to work on Ubuntu 12.04LTS and 14.04LTS
