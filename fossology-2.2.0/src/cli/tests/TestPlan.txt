Required Parameters
-------------------
Required parameters are:
-p <folder-path>
-n <folder>
-a <path to archive>
-d <description>

1. Check for required parameters

NOTE: tests like -p -n foo will always fail as -n becomes the argument
to -p and so on.  Might try putting them at the end of the line to
see if that works for forcing the isset error check in the switch
statement.

   1.1 no -p 
   1.1.1 -p -n foo
   1.2 no -n
   1.2.1 -p bla -n -a /foo/bar
   1.3 no -a (-n foo /foo/bar -d "Test with no -a")
   1.3.1 archive does not exist
   1.3.2 archive is empty (0 bytes)
   1.3.3 archive is compressed
   1.3.4 archive is a file
   1.3.5 archive is a url, but -w is not thrown.
   1.4 no -d but a "description"
   1.4.1 -d but no description (put at the end of the line)

2. Other tests
   2.1 check that no alpha buckets are used with no -A given
   2.2 specify -w but archive is a tar (should fail and produce error)
    
Optional Parameters
-------------------
Optional parameters are:
-A
A.1 Look in output for the correct alpha bucket (e.g. a-c)

-f <path to file of commands>
F.1
   1.1 no filename given
   1.2 file is empty (0 bytes)
   1.3 specify other parameters, make sure no errors from them (they are
   supposed to be ignored, so how would that get tested?)... try
   specifying invalid ones if there are no errors, they were ignored.

F.2 Check required parameters (save as above)
   NOTE: either use the same tests as in 1 above, or duplicate the tests,
         (bad idea).
     
     
-w (the archive must start with http*)
W.1 
   1.1 -w archive is url
   1.2 -w archive is url, but can't get it (problem with url)
   1.3 -w archive is not a url (try multiple things) This should produce an
       error.

More Functional tests 
---------------------
(did it do what it said it was going to do?)

Thought here is to use the web feature of simple test to see if we can see 
the folders that were specified and see if there is a job running and the 
proper entry under the folders on the web page itself.
 
1. load archive with no alpha buckets
2. load archive with alpha buckets
3. Create empty intermediate folders (not alpha)
4. Use an alpha bucket name for a folder (should'nt matter)
?? what else ??
