	GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

	Version 2.1, February 1999

	Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA Everyone is permitted to copy
and distribute verbatim copies of this license document, but changing it is
not allowed.

	[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts as
the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence the version
number 2.1.]

	Preamble

	The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are
intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make
sure the software is free for all its users.

	This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free
Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it
too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or
the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use in any
particular case, based on the explanations below.

	When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not
price. Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this
service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.

	To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights. These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if
you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

	For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or
for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you
link other code with the library, you must provide complete object files to
the recipients, so that they can relink them with the library after making
changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms
so they know their rights.

	We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission
to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

	To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is
no warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone
else and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be
affected by problems that might be introduced by others.

	Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any
free program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict
the users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent
holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version
of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in
this license.

	Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary
GNU General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public
License, applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from
the ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain
libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

	When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a
shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined
work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public
License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits
its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax
criteria for linking other code with the library.

	We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.
It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the
ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

	For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage
the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General
Public License.

	In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as
well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

	Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with
the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
modified version of the Library.

	The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work
based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains
code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the
library in order to run.

	TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

	0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser
General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

	A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared
so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of
those functions and data) to form executables.

	The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means
either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)

	"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
library.

	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a
program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
the Library does.

	1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
License along with the Library.

	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

	2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

	a) The modified work must itself be a software library. b) You must cause
the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed the
files and the date of any change. c) You must cause the whole of the work to
be licensed at no charge to all third parties under the terms of this
License. d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the
facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then
you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application
does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and
performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful. (For example, a
function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is entirely
well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d
requires that any application-supplied function or table used by this
function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
root function must still compute square roots.)

	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
works based on the Library.

	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
of this License.

	3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this,
you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer
to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this
License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

	Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent
copies and derivative works made from that copy.

	This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
Library into a program that is not a library.

	4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange.

	If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
object code.

	5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it,
is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.

	However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates
an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The
executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for
distribution of such executables.

	When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that
is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work
of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if
the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not
precisely defined by law.

	If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines
or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted,
regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall
under Section 6.)

	Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
linked directly with the Library itself.

	6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice,
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's
own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

	You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution
displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the
Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

	a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work
(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is
an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
"work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable
containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes
the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able
to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.) b) Use a
suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable
mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already
present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library functions
into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified version of
the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with. c)
Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a
charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution. d) If
distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated
place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the
same place. e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
materials or that you have already sent this user a copy. For an executable,
the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any data
and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However,
as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include
anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with
the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

	It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
together in an executable that you distribute.

	7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided
that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the
other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
these two things:

	a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
distributed under the terms of the Sections above. b) Give prominent notice
with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work based on the
Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the
same work. 8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

	9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

	10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

	11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Library.

	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
free software distribution system which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice.

	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a consequence of the rest of this License.

	12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

	13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

	Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

	14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to
the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

	NO WARRANTY

	15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

	16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

	If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

	To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

	one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.

	This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public License as published by the

option) any later version.

	This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU Lesser General Public License

information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

	You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined
work, a derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public
License therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits
its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax
criteria for linking other code with the library.

	We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does
Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License.
It also provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over
competing non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the
ordinary General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser
license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.

	For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage
the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the
library. A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as
widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by
limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General
Public License.

	In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free
software. For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free
programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as
well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.

	Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with
the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
modified version of the Library.

	The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work
based on the library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains
code derived from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the
library in order to run.

	TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

	0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other
authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser
General Public License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is
addressed as "you".

	A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared
so as to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of
those functions and data) to form executables.

	The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which
has been distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means
either the Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to
say, a work containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or
with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly into another language.
(Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)

	"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the
library.

	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a
program using the Library is not restricted, and output from such a program
is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the Library
(independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it). Whether
that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses
the Library does.

	1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete
source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously
and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this
License along with the Library.

	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

	2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

	a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

	b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.

	c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to
all third parties under the terms of this License.

	d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table
of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility,
other than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must
make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not
supply such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs
whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.

	(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application.
Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or
table used by this function must be optional: if the application does not
supply it, the square root function must still compute square roots.)

	These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License,
and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as
separate works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole
which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be
on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
works based on the Library.

	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
of this License.

	3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this,
you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer
to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this
License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General
Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.

	Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that
copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent
copies and derivative works made from that copy.

	This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the
Library into a program that is not a library.

	4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of
it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete
corresponding machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under
the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software
interchange.

	If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code
from the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
object code.

	5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library,
but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it,
is called a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a
derivative work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this
License.

	However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates
an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains
portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The
executable is therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for
distribution of such executables.

	When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that
is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work
of the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if
the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not
precisely defined by law.

	If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure
layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines
or less in length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted,
regardless of whether it is legally a derivative work. (Executables
containing this object code plus portions of the Library will still fall
under Section 6.)

	Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute
the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are
linked directly with the Library itself.

	6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a
"work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing
portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice,
provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's
own use and reverse engineering for debugging such modifications.

	You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this
License. You must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution
displays copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the
Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of
this License. Also, you must do one of these things:

	a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work
(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is
an executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable
"work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable
containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes
the contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able
to recompile the application to use the modified definitions.)

	b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library.
A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

	c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above,
for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.

	d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified
materials from the same place.

	e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
that you have already sent this user a copy.

	For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library"
must include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the
executable from it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so
on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
component itself accompanies the executable.

	It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions
of other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating
system. Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library
together in an executable that you distribute.

	7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided
that the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the
other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do
these two things:

	a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.

	b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

	8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the
Library except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt
otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.
However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under this
License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties
remain in full compliance.

	9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
Library or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.

	10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to
these terms and conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on
the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not
responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.

	11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Library at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Library.

	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
free software distribution system which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice.

	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a consequence of the rest of this License.

	12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

	13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions
will be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
address new problems or concerns.

	Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

	14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to
the author to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the
Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes
make exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

	NO WARRANTY

	15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

	16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

	If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

	To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

	one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.

	This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but

	GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

	Version 2, June 1991

	Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA

	Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble

	The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You
can apply it to your programs, too.

	When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and
that you know you can do these things.

	To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the software, or if you modify it.

	For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

	We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

	Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

	Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

	The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

	TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

	0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the
Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does.

	1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

	2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

	a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any
work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is
derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the
modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must
cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it.

	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
works based on the Program.

	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
of this License.

	3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

	a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with
a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for
a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,
a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you
received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the
preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable
work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it
contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

	If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
object code.

	4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

	5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

	6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

	7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Program.

	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice.

	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a consequence of the rest of this License.

	8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.

	9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

	Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

	10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

	NO WARRANTY

	11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

	12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

	If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free
software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

	To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to
attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright"
line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

	one line to give the program's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) yyyy name of author

	This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option) any
later version.

	This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but
WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. See the GNU General Public License for more
details.

	You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 51
Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301, USA. Also add
information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

	If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this
when it starts in an interactive mode:

	Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision
comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type `show w'. This is free
software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
type `show c' for details. The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c'
should show the appropriate parts of the General Public License. Of course,
the commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

	You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if
necessary. Here is a sample; alter the names:

	Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
`Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

	signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989 Ty Coon, President of Vice This
General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs. If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library. If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Lesser General Public
License instead of this License.

DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

	Version 2, June 1991

	Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc. 51 Franklin
Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA  02110-1301, USA

	Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this
license document, but changing it is not allowed. Preamble

	The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to
share and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended
to guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users. This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program
whose authors commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation
software is covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.) You
can apply it to your programs, too.

	When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the
freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if
you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that
you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and
that you know you can do these things.

	To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone
to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the software, or if you modify it.

	For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have. You
must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. And you
must show them these terms so they know their rights.

	We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and
(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

	Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software. If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

	Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be
licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

	The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

	TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

	0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the
terms of this General Public License. The "Program", below, refers to any
such program or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the
Program or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with
modifications and/or translated into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".) Each
licensee is addressed as "you".

	Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running the
Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if
its contents constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having
been made by running the Program). Whether that is true depends on what the
Program does.

	1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this
License and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of
the Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

	You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you
may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

	2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of
it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such
modifications or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you
also meet all of these conditions:

	a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change. b) You must cause any
work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or in part contains or is
derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no
charge to all third parties under the terms of this License. c) If the
modified program normally reads commands interactively when run, you must
cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the most ordinary
way, to print or display an announcement including an appropriate copyright
notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under these
conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this License.
(Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does not normally print
such an announcement, your work based on the Program is not required to print
an announcement.) These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.
If identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and
can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in themselves,
then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those sections when you
distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same sections
as part of a whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other
licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each and every part
regardless of who wrote it.

	Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or collective
works based on the Program.

	In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program
with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a
storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope
of this License.

	3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

	a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on
a medium customarily used for software interchange; or, b) Accompany it with
a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give any third party, for
a charge no more than your cost of physically performing source distribution,
a complete machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily
used for software interchange; or, c) Accompany it with the information you
received as to the offer to distribute corresponding source code. (This
alternative is allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
received the program in object code or executable form with such an offer, in
accord with Subsection b above.) The source code for a work means the
preferred form of the work for making modifications to it. For an executable
work, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it
contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
used to control compilation and installation of the executable. However, as a
special exception, the source code distributed need not include anything that
is normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the
executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

	If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access
to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code,
even though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the
object code.

	4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except
as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically
terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who have received
copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

	5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed
it. However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the
Program or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you
do not accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the
Program (or any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of
this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

	6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the original
licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties to this License.

	7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse
you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other
pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
Program at all. For example, if a patent license would not permit
royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who receive copies
directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could satisfy both
it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Program.

	If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

	It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any such
claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the
free software distribution system, which is implemented by public license
practices. Many people have made generous contributions to the wide range of
software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or
she is willing to distribute software through any other system and a licensee
cannot impose that choice.

	This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be
a consequence of the rest of this License.

	8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an
explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so
that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.
In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.

	9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions
of the General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

	Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software
Foundation. If the Program does not specify a version number of this License,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

	10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to
ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make
exceptions for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of
preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and of
promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.

	NO WARRANTY

	11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY
FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN
OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES
PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR
IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO
THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE PROGRAM
PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR
CORRECTION.

	12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR
REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,
INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING
OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR
THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER
PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

	END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

	How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

	If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free
software which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

	To do so, attach the following notices to the program. It is safest to

	Software classified as freeware is licensed at no cost and is either
fully functional for an unlimited time; or has only basic functions enabled
with a fully functional version available commercially or as shareware.[8] In
contrast to free software, the author usually restricts one or more rights of
the user, including the rights to use, copy, distribute, modify and make
derivative works of the software or extract the source code.[1][2][9][10] The
software license may impose various additional restrictions on the type of
use, e.g. only for personal use, private use, individual use, non-profit use,
non-commercial use, academic use, educational use, use in charity or
humanitarian organizations, non-military use, use by public authorities or
various other combinations of these type of restrictions.[11] For instance,
the license may be "free for private, non-commercial use". The software
license may also impose various other restrictions, such as restricted use
over a network, restricted use on a server, restricted use in a combination
with some types of other software or with some hardware devices, prohibited
distribution over the Internet other than linking to author's website,
restricted distribution without author's consent, restricted number of
copies, etc.
