// NOTE: This code is not really used anymore !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

// For now, assume previous process has determined if the archive has changed
// and just calls this routine to do the load.  That is, this routine is
// not expected to determine if the archive has changed.

//issues:
// what to do if all the data is not present.  For example, osrb projects
// may not have a version, rank, or other data that is there for projects
// from freshmeat.  Talk with Bob, use some sort of 'default' if there
// is no data.

# 1. process parameter(s) and sanity check.
# 2. connect to db
# 3. If folder doesn't exist, create it.
#    is it possible to make this recursive and do subfolders as well?
# 4. After all needed folders are created,
# things are a bit fuzzy below....
# 5. create upload record.
# 6. unpack
# 7. schedule nomos...
# What else?
/*
 * general process is: createfolders, then use createfoldercontents to
 * associate folders with each other....
