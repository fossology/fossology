=head1 NAME

diffm: find the differences between two Freshmeat Rdf format files and record
the files that have differences and save the associated XML for that project 
in a file.

B<diffm> returns the number of differences found or 0 for no differences.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

diffm -f <file1> <file2> [-o <dir-path>]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<diffm> extracts the project short name and the latest
release version from a Freshmeat rdf format XML file and stores them in arrays.
The arrays are sorted and then diff'ed. Any differences in the latest release version
cause that project to be added to the list of projects that need updating.
The associated xml entries with that project are also added to the xml
file that will be used by B<get-projects> to retrieve them from the net.

B<diffm> always creates two output files.  I<FM-projects2update.yyyy-mm-dd> and
I<Update.fm.rdf.yyyy-mm-dd>.  The first file is a list of the files
and the new version that should be updated.  The second file is a XML file
that can be used by B<get-projects> to obtain the new projects from Freshmeat.
The year and date used are the current date when the program is run.

B<diffm> returns the number of differences found or 0 for no differences.
