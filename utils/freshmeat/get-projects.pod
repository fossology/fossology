=head1 NAME

get-projects: Process a Freshmeat Rdf format XML file and get the projects
in that file from Freashmeat using wget.
YOU ARE NOT DONE TILL THIS LINE IS REMOVED!

=head1 SYNOPSIS

get-projects [-h] -f <file>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<get-projects> reads an uncompressed XML file in Freshmeat Rdf format and
attempts to get each project in the file from the Freshmeat site using 
B<wget>.

While processing the XML file, B<get-projects> creates a number of output files.

All of the archives are placed in a directory called I<golden.yyyymmdd> where
yyyymmdd is the year month day the program was run.  In the golden directory are
3 other directories used to store log or input files.

At the end of processing B<get-projects> prints a summary of it's efforts on
standard out.

Getting the archives can take a lot of space.  B<get-projects> gets the path
for the golden directories from an environment variable  in the makefile Makefile.utils.
The path is site specific and so the makefile B<must> be adjusted based on
your site.

=over

=item I<wget-logs>

Stores all of the wget logs.  These logs are needed to determine if the wget
was successful.

=item I<Log-Data>

Contains files that record the wgets that failed and uploads that were skipped.
The file names are I<failed-wgets> and I<skipped_uploads>.  The format for
the I<failed-wgets> file is the package rank, name and archive on each line 
seperated by spaces.  The format for the I<skipped_uploads> file is the project name
and the path to the archive, both in single quotes seperated by a space.
