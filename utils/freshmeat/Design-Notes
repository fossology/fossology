Restart Notes for Freshmeat.

Last updated: 10-26-2007

Outline of programs needed:

1. Shell script to be driven from cron
   - Gets the daily fm rdf and makes the top 1000 for comparison
   - Call diffm to compare
   - if output file from diffm says something to get
     - get projects
   - using output files from get projects, construct a load file with clf.
   - use cp2foss to upload and make folders using input file.
   
   SUMMARY:
     - Shell script
     - mktop1k
     - diffm
     - get-projects
     - create-fm-loadfile
     - cp2foss.

2. Overall actions needed.

#1. Fix up svn with respect to eclipse.... got svn working from eclipse....
  Do this on Nov. 1.
    - Review mktop1k
        DONE: looks good.  No real changes needed.
    - review diffm
        DONE: no real changes, added some comments to make things a bit clearer.
        UPDATE: Need to add a parameter on where to place output files... just drops them in cwd that shell script ran in...
        won't work from cron.
    - create shell script (leverage neals)
      Status: 10-26: shell script now gets the rdf, makes top 1k, diffs with previous top 1k.
    - review get-projects
      STATUS: partial review done.  Looked at enough to know that this is where a lot of rework will get done.
              -> rework gp in light of the whole process!  
    - Create create-fm-loadfile -> LOOK at cp2repo as well, didn't you already do this?
      -> Looks like an older version of get_projects created the input file (cp2repo references it and parses it).
      -> want to find that version.... 
      -> don't worry about that now.... 
    - obsolete mk_fmdirs.php, code is old, not needed and buggy in terms of folders.....
