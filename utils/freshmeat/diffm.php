 * diffm: determine if there is a difference between top 1000 Freshmeat
 * project rdf files.
 *
 * The top 1000 rfd files are expected to be extracted from the larger
 * Freshmeat rdf's obtained from the FM site. The general use is for consecutive
 * days to be diff'ed.  If the files are drastically different, then the upload
 * size will approach 1000 projects.
 *
 * See mktop1k to create a top1000 Freshmeat file from the master rdf file.
 *
 * @param string $file1 path to top1000 fm projects (XML file)
 * @param string $file2 path to top1000 fm projects (XML file)
 * @param string $opath optional directory path to place to output files.
 *        default is to use the current directory.
 *
 * diffm produces two output files:
 * FM-projects2update is a list of Freshmeat projects that need updating.
 * Update.fm.rdf is an XML file with the Freshmeat entries that need updating.  This
 * file can be processed by get-projects to get the projects and to create a load file.
 * Use cp2foss to load the projects into the fossology DB, using the inputfile created
 * by get-projects.
 *
 * If there are no differences found, diffm returns 0 and the above files
 * are removed.
 *
 * @return exit status of 0 for no differences found, > 0 for differences
 * found.

/*
* This program works by extracting the project short name and the latest
* release version from an rdf and storing them in arrays.  The arrays are
* sorted and then diff'ed. Any differences in the latest release version
* cause that project to be added to the list of projects that need updating.
* The associated xml entries with that project are also added to the xml
* file that will be used by get-projects to retrieve them from the net.

Usage: diffm [-h] -f <file1> <file2> [-o <dir-path>]
   Where <file1> path to an uncompressed top1000 Freshmeat rdf XML file
         <file2> path to an uncompressed top1000 Freshmeat rdf XML file

         For the differences to be found as expected file1 should be the newer
         file.  E.g. f1.2008-1-14 f2.2008-1-13.

         <dir-path> fully qualified path where output files will be placed.
         If no -o option given, the cwd is used for the output files.

         Output files are: FM-projects2update and Update.fm.rdf

   See mktop1k to create a top1000 Freshmeat file from the master rdf file.
