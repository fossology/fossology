# NOTE: most definitions come from ../Makefile.conf  These paths 
# are specific to the Freshmeat process.

#
# Data storage for downloaded freshmeat archives.
# NOTE: this area should be at a minimum of 500GB if you plan on loading
# multiple days of updates.  For example to get the top 1000 Freshmeat
# archives and 1 day of updates where only the projects with version 
# changes have been downloaded takes ~ 100GB
#
# Edit the line below to reflect where the Freshmeat process should
# store it's data.  The program get-projects uses the FMDIR variable.
# The default is /tmp (a very poor choice, so please change it)
# NOTE: make sure to put a trailing slash on the path, the scripts that
# use the path expect it.
#
# For example if the storage is located at: /srv/storage/fossology
# FMDATADIR=/srv/storage/fossology/
#

FMDATADIR=/tmp/

FMDIR=$(FMDATADIR)Freshmeat
